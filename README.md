The code used to generate the figures and tables in this study can be found in the 'Final_Simulations' folder and in the 'Lagrangian Simulations' folder, all other code included in this repository is old and included only to provide greater context.

The fish and benthic data supporting this research are sensitive and not available publicly. The majority of Fiji coral reef monitoring (fish and benthic data) used in this study are owned by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). Data may be made available to qualified researchers by contacting the WCS Fiji Country Director at infofiji@wcs.org and requesting a data sharing agreement for the following datasets: 2018_Ovalau Island rapid assessment surveys; 2019_OvalauIsland_BAF_Macmon_surveys; 2019_Macmon_Bua_Ra_Kubulau; 2019_Dama Bureta Waibula and Dawasamu-WISH ecological survey; 2017_Koro Island rapid assessment surveys; 2020_NamenaAndVatuira coral reef surveys; 2018_Vatu-i-Ra reef surveys. The 2017_Northern Lau dataset is owned by the Vatuvara Foundation. Data may be made available to qualified researchers by contacting katy@vatuvara.org. The hydrodynamic data used to run the Lagrangian larval dispersal simulations are freely available from the E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information: https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021.
